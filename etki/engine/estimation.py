"""Effort estimation (Epic F): three-point + triangular/PERT distribution → P10–P80 range.

Golden rule: never give a single number, give a range (cone of uncertainty).
Sources: analogy (similar past work), code metrics (LOC), churn risk. Percentiles
are computed analytically — no RNG, fully deterministic (critical for the gate).

The constants (LOC/hour, optimistic/pessimistic factors, churn widening, base
hours) are NOT EMBEDDED IN CODE — they come from config via `EstimationParams`
(`Settings.estimation_params()`; env: ETKI_EST_*). As pilot data accumulates,
`pilot/calibration.py` produces suggestions for these constants; a human approves
and updates the config.
