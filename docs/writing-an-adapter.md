# Writing an adapter / plugin

Adapters are Etki's main extension point — and the most wanted contribution.
The core is hexagonal: the decision engine, indexer and API talk only to abstract
**ports** and never mention a vendor. Core code never changes; which adapter is
active is **configuration, never code**. Two ways to ship one:

1. **In-tree adapter** (a PR to this repo): one new file under `etki/adapters/`
   plus one registry branch — the classic path, described below.
2. **Plugin package** (your own repo/distribution): a package depending only on
   **[`etki-api`](https://pypi.org/project/etki-api/)** that declares an
   `etki.adapters` entry point — see
   [Shipping it as a plugin package](#shipping-it-as-a-plugin-package).
   The first-party reference is
   [`packages/etki-plugin-linear`](https://github.com/yasinyaman/etki/tree/master/packages/etki-plugin-linear).

> Looking for what the *existing* adapters pull (endpoints, field mappings, known
> limitations)? See the [Adapter reference](adapters.md).

## The ports

The **external-integration ports** (the first six rows below) live in the frozen
plugin API package [`etki-api`](https://github.com/yasinyaman/etki/tree/master/packages/etki-api)
(`from etki_api import WorkItemProvider, WorkItem, Capabilities`); `etki/core/ports.py`
re-exports them, so in-tree code may import from either — plugins import **only**
`etki_api`. The internal ports (`WikiStore`, `GraphQueryPort`, persistence) stay in
[`etki/core/ports.py`](https://github.com/yasinyaman/etki/blob/master/etki/core/ports.py)
and are not part of the plugin API. All are `typing.Protocol`s — adapters satisfy
them *structurally*, no base class to inherit:

| Port | Abstracts | Methods |
|---|---|---|
| `WorkItemProvider` | the work tracker (Jira, GitLab, ADO…) | `get_work_item(id)`, `find_similar(description, limit=5)`, `capabilities()` |
| `CodeRepositoryProvider` | repo + module graph (Joern, AST…) | `list_modules()`, `get_impacted(module_hint)`, `capabilities()` |
| `DocumentSourceProvider` | the document source (filesystem, Confluence, SharePoint…) | `list_documents()`, `fetch_content(id)`, `capabilities()` |
| `LLMClient` | the LLM serving layer (optional) | `complete_json(system=, user=)` |
| `EmbeddingProvider` | embeddings, OpenAI-compatible (optional) | `embed(texts, kind=)` |
| `RerankProvider` | a TEI-compatible cross-encoder (optional) | `rerank(query, documents)` |
| `RequestIntakeProvider` | pulls new client requests from a tracker (poll) | `fetch_new(cursor=, limit=20)`, `capabilities()` |
| `ResponseChannel` | writes the decision back (comment/status) — the first WRITING port | `post_response(response)`, `capabilities()` |
| `WikiStore` | the decision-memory store (default: filesystem markdown) | `write_decision(case)`, `search(project, query)`, `rebuild(project, cases)`, `write_precedent(…)`, `write_disputed(…)` |
| `GraphQueryPort` | retrieval over the knowledge graph | `find_k_nodes(text, k)`, `expand(seeds, hops, budget, query=)`, `nl_query(question)` |

All data crossing a port is **normalized** in vendor-neutral models
(`etki/core/models.py`). The single most important normalization:
**`WorkItem.effort_seconds`** — whatever the tracker calls time spent (Jira
`timespent`, GitLab `total_time_spent`, Redmine `spent_hours`,
Azure DevOps `CompletedWork`), the adapter converts it to seconds. That field
powers effort-by-analogy estimation.

## Worked example: a WorkItemProvider

The real reference is [`adapters/jira_work_item.py`](https://github.com/yasinyaman/etki/blob/master/etki/adapters/jira_work_item.py)
(~80 lines). The skeleton every work-item adapter follows:

```python
"""Acme Tracker WorkItemProvider.

Effort in Acme comes from <vendor field>; the core only ever sees the
normalized WorkItem.effort_seconds. Needs a live server → integration is
CI-skipped; pure parsing is unit-tested.
"""
from __future__ import annotations

import httpx

from etki_api import Capabilities, WorkItem


class AcmeWorkItemProvider:
    def __init__(self, base_url: str, api_token: str, timeout: float = 30.0) -> None:
        self._base_url = base_url.rstrip("/")
        self._token = api_token
        self._timeout = timeout

    def _to_work_item(self, raw: dict) -> WorkItem:
        # ALL vendor quirks die here — nothing vendor-shaped leaves this method.
        return WorkItem(
            id=str(raw["id"]),
            title=raw.get("subject", ""),
            description=raw.get("body", ""),
            status=raw.get("state"),
            effort_seconds=int(raw.get("minutes_spent", 0)) * 60,  # normalize!
        )

    async def get_work_item(self, item_id: str) -> WorkItem:
        async with httpx.AsyncClient(timeout=self._timeout) as client:
            r = await client.get(f"{self._base_url}/api/items/{item_id}",
                                 headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {self._token}"})
            r.raise_for_status()
            return self._to_work_item(r.json())

    async def find_similar(self, description: str, *, limit: int = 5) -> list[WorkItem]:
        ...  # vendor search API → [self._to_work_item(x) for x in hits[:limit]]

    def capabilities(self) -> Capabilities:
        # Declare honestly — the system degrades gracefully from this
        # (no webhooks → polling; no effort tracking → code-metric estimates).
        return Capabilities(supports_effort_tracking=True)
```

### Register it (the only other file you touch)

One branch in the relevant builder in
[`adapters/registry.py`](https://github.com/yasinyaman/etki/blob/master/etki/adapters/registry.py):

```python
if cfg.adapter == "acme":
    return AcmeWorkItemProvider(opt["base_url"], _secret(opt["api_token"]))
```

`_secret()` resolves `env:VARIABLE` references, so tokens never sit in YAML:

```yaml
connectors:
  work_items:
    adapter: acme
    options:
      base_url: https://acme.example.com
      api_token: env:ACME_TOKEN
```

### Test it

Follow [`tests/unit/test_jira.py`](https://github.com/yasinyaman/etki/blob/master/tests/unit/test_jira.py):

1. **Pure parsing, no network** — feed `_to_work_item` a captured payload dict and
   assert the normalization (especially `effort_seconds`).
2. **Capabilities** — assert the declaration matches reality.
3. **Graceful degradation** — anything needing a live server must be CI-skipped,
   and triage must survive your adapter being unreachable: the engine already
   catches `find_similar` errors and falls back to code-metric estimates
   (`TriageEngine._safe_find_similar`); don't wrap your errors in ways that hide them.
4. For engine-level tests, in-memory fakes live in `etki/adapters/fakes/` —
   your adapter is *not* needed to test core logic.

## Shipping it as a plugin package

The same provider class, packaged out-of-tree. Your distribution depends **only on
`etki-api`** (never on `etki`) and declares three things:

**1. A `PluginSpec`** — the runtime contract, a module-level instance:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from etki_api import AdapterFactory, PluginSpec, SecurityCapabilities


class AcmeOptions(BaseModel):
    """Validated BEFORE build(); secrets (env:VAR) arrive already resolved."""
    base_url: str
    api_token: str
    timeout: float = 30.0


def _build(options: BaseModel) -> AcmeWorkItemProvider:
    opts = AcmeOptions.model_validate(options.model_dump())
    return AcmeWorkItemProvider(opts.base_url, opts.api_token, timeout=opts.timeout)


PLUGIN = PluginSpec(
    name="etki-plugin-acme",
    api_compat=">=0.1,<0.2",          # PEP 440 range against etki-api
    capabilities=SecurityCapabilities(  # SECURITY declaration (KVKK inventory),
        network=True,                   # separate from the functional Capabilities
        filesystem="none",
        external_write=False,           # True if the plugin WRITES out (e.g. a ResponseChannel
                                        # posting comments) — shown at install time
        endpoints=["acme.example.com"],
    ),
    adapters=(AdapterFactory(port="work_items", name="acme",
                             options_model=AcmeOptions, build=_build),),
)
```

**2. An entry point** in your `pyproject.toml` — this is how Etki discovers you:

```toml
[project.entry-points."etki.adapters"]
acme = "etki_plugin_acme:PLUGIN"
```

**3. An `etki-plugin.toml` manifest** at the repo/wheel root — the *static twin*
of the spec, readable **without executing your code** (the install confirmation
prompt and the marketplace index read it; `etki plugin verify` cross-checks it
against the spec and fails on drift):

```toml
[plugin]
name = "etki-plugin-acme"
type = "adapter"
api_compat = ">=0.1,<0.2"

[plugin.capabilities]
network = true
filesystem = "none"
endpoints = ["acme.example.com"]

[[plugin.adapters]]
port = "work_items"
name = "acme"
options_model = "etki_plugin_acme:AcmeOptions"
```

Once installed next to Etki, `adapter: acme` in `connectors.yaml` resolves to your
plugin — no registry branch needed.

### Distributing your plugin

Three channels, gated by the operator-side `ETKI_PLUGIN_POLICY`
(operational details: [RUNBOOK §Plugins](RUNBOOK.md#plugins-install-lockfile-policy)):

- **Git tag** — `python -m etki.plugin install git+https://…@v1.0.0` (needs
  `allow_git`). Branch refs are rejected; the tag resolves to a full commit SHA,
  which is what installs and gets pinned in the operator's `etki-plugins.lock`.
- **Wheel** — `install ./etki_plugin_acme-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl --sha256 <hash>`
  (needs `allow_local`; the hash is verified before anything runs).
- **Verified marketplace** — an entry in the signed index at
  [`https://yasinyaman.github.io/etki-plugins/index.json`](https://yasinyaman.github.io/etki-plugins/index.json)
  makes your plugin installable under the DEFAULT policy (`verified_only`).
  Getting listed is a PR against
  [yasinyaman/etki-plugins](https://github.com/yasinyaman/etki-plugins)
  carrying three things (full criteria:
  [PROCESS.md](https://github.com/yasinyaman/etki-plugins/blob/master/PROCESS.md)):

  1. your wheel under `artifacts/` — build it (`uv build`), note its hash
     (`shasum -a 256 dist/*.whl`);
  2. a green conformance report under `reports/` —
     `python -m etki_api.conformance etki-plugin-acme --report report.json`
     (`failed: 0`; its `version`/`api_compat`/`etki_api_version` fields feed
     the index's compatibility matrix);
  3. your `index.json` entry: name/summary/source repo/ports, an honest
     capability declaration, and per-version `api_compat` +
     `artifact.sha256` + `conformance_report` + `released_at`.

  All three pieces are built in one command (in-tree tooling — wheel, green
  conformance report, and a **schema-validated** `index.json` entry, assembled
  under `dist/submission/<plugin>/`):

  ```bash
  uv run python scripts/build_plugin_submission.py etki-plugin-acme
  ```

  Or run the **Plugin submission bundle** GitHub Action (`workflow_dispatch`,
  pick the plugin) and download the bundle as an artifact. Either way you then
  open the PR against `etki-plugins` with the produced files.

  On merge, CI re-validates the schema and every hash, re-signs the index
  (sigstore keyless, identity pinned to that repo's release workflow) and
  republishes the Pages site — no further action on your side.

In every channel the install confirmation prompt shows your `etki-plugin.toml`
capability declaration (network / filesystem / endpoints) to the operator
**without executing your code** — keep it honest and minimal; it is also what
KVKK/compliance reviews inspect.

### Your plugin in the UI

A plugin never ships its own screens — the web UI is always a projection of what
the plugin declares:

- **Ayarlar → Eklentiler** lists every installed plugin: name, version (+git
  commit), install source (from the lockfile), `api_compat`, ports, state
  (`active/failed/incompatible/blocked/disabled`) with the error text, and a
  verified badge. The only mutation is a pmo-only enable/disable toggle;
  install/remove and `ETKI_PLUGIN_POLICY` stay on the operator/CLI side.
- **Marketplace card** (same screen): once your plugin is accepted into the
  signed index, its entry renders there automatically — `summary`, `ports`, the
  `capabilities` declaration from your manifest, `source_repo`/conformance links
  (http(s) only), and the highest version whose `api_compat` covers the
  installed etki-api, next to a copyable `python -m etki.plugin install …`
  command. The card is a projection of the index: good metadata in your index
  entry IS your store listing. When the operator sets `ETKI_PLUGIN_UI_INSTALL=true`,
  the card also offers a one-click **verified install** (env-pinned source,
  capability confirm, the same signature + SHA-256 chain as the CLI).
- **Plugin detail page** (`/ayarlar/eklentiler/<plugin>`): your `options_model`
  powers a **default-options form** — field names containing key/token/secret/
  password/pat render as masked password inputs that are never echoed back.
  Defaults merge UNDER project options at build time (the project value wins),
  so name your credential fields conventionally (`api_key`, `token`, …) and
  keep non-secret knobs (timeouts, conventions) as plain typed fields.
- **Work-item adapter dropdown** (project → Dosyalar) is fed by
  `registry.available_adapters("work_items")`: builtins first, then the adapter
  names of ACTIVE plugins — your `AdapterFactory.name` appears there
  automatically once the plugin loads. Options are entered as `key: value`
  lines and validated through your `options_model` at build time (secrets as
  `env:VAR` references, resolved by core — your plugin only ever sees values).
- **Talep Kanalı card** (same screen) is the twin for a `RequestIntakeProvider` /
  `ResponseChannel` pair: one card configures the adapter, its options (typed
  from your `options_model`) and the write-back timing (`on_decision` / `on_triage`
  / `both`) together. An `external_write` capability surfaces in the install
  confirm and the plugin/market cards as "dış sisteme yazma".
- Every triage decision is stamped with the active plugin set
  (`TriageDecision.plugin_set`, e.g. `etki-plugin-acme@1.0.0`) for the audit
  trail.

## Port contracts & the conformance suite ("AdapterBench")

The ports are `runtime_checkable Protocol`s — `isinstance` only checks that the
methods EXIST. The **conformance suite** (`etki_api.conformance`, extra
`etki-api[conformance]`) pins the documented SEMANTICS. These are the contracts
it encodes (reviewed against the Jira/Linear adapters and the fakes):

| Port | Contract |
|---|---|
| `WorkItemProvider` | `find_similar` returns a **list** of `WorkItem` (≤ `limit`; empty or a recent-items fallback on no match — **never an exception**); Turkish/unicode text accepted; every item normalized (`id` non-empty, `effort_seconds` an `int ≥ 0`); `capabilities()` sync, stable |
| `CodeRepositoryProvider` | `list_modules` returns `CodeModule`s with **unique ids**; `get_impacted(None)` and unknown hints return a list (empty ok), never raise; impacted ⊆ listed graph |
| `DocumentSourceProvider` | `list_documents` returns `DocumentRef`s with unique ids; **every listed id is fetchable** and yields `bytes` (not `str`) |
| `LLMClient` | `complete_json` returns a `dict` |
| `EmbeddingProvider` | one vector per input, aligned, uniform non-zero dimension, floats; both `kind`s accepted; **deterministic** for the same input (auditable matching) |
| `RerankProvider` | one float score per document, aligned with input order (raw logits) |
| `RegistryMetadataProvider` | `latest` returns `PackageMetadata` or `None`; unknown package / backend failure **degrades to `None`**, never raises |
| `RequestIntakeProvider` | `fetch_new` returns an `IntakeBatch` (≤ `limit`; every item has a non-empty `external_id` and some title/description); an exhausted source returns an **empty list, never an exception**; the cursor is **opaque** and makes monotonic progress (re-fetching with a returned cursor does not re-emit its ids) |
| `ResponseChannel` | `post_response` to a known target succeeds; an unknown target **RAISES** (failures must surface — the host is the only best-effort layer, and posting is **not idempotent**, so the host dedups) |

Two ways to run it:

1. **In your test suite** — subclass the contract class, provide an *offline*
   `provider` fixture (canned data / mock transport; never live credentials):

   ```python
   from etki_api.conformance import WorkItemProviderContract

   class TestAcmeConformance(WorkItemProviderContract):
       known_item_id = "ACME-1"          # optional: exercises get_work_item

       @pytest.fixture
       def provider(self):
           return offline_acme_provider()
   ```

2. **Zero test code** — declare a `conformance` factory on your `PluginSpec`
   returning offline provider instances per port, then:

   ```bash
   python -m etki_api.conformance etki-plugin-acme --report conformance-report.json
   # or, with etki installed: python -m etki.plugin verify etki-plugin-acme
   ```

   The JSON report carries the version-compat matrix fields
   (`version`, `api_compat`, `etki_api_version`) the verified marketplace
   consumes. Exit code 0 = conformant.

**CI in one job** — the repo publishes a reusable workflow; add to your plugin's CI:

```yaml
jobs:
  conformance:
    uses: yasinyaman/etki/.github/workflows/plugin-conformance.yml@master
    with:
      plugin-dist: etki-plugin-acme
```

If your repo uses pytest-asyncio in `strict` mode, nothing extra is needed —
the contract tests carry their own `@pytest.mark.asyncio` markers.

### Optional methods (shadow contracts)

One method sits OUTSIDE the frozen `WorkItemProvider` protocol but is probed by
the host via `hasattr`/`getattr`:

- **`all_items() -> list[WorkItem]`** — cheap enumeration of every work item.
  The host uses it to compute **effort-pool consumption** (per-category spent
  hours), the background pool refresh, and the KPI/pool screens
  (`etki/index_tools.py`, `etki/api/context.py`, `etki/api/web.py`,
  `etki/pilot/__main__.py`). A provider without it still triages fine — the
  pool degrades to an empty consumption dict (documented degradation, same
  spirit as `Capabilities`). Implement it only when your backend can enumerate
  cheaply (the built-in `file` adapter does; a paged REST tracker usually
  should not). It is deliberately not part of the port: adding it to the
  `runtime_checkable` Protocol would make `isinstance` require it and break
  existing adapters. The conformance suite therefore does not test it.

### etki-api versioning policy

- `etki-api` follows **semver**: major = breaking, minor = new optional
  method/field, patch = fixes. Every change is recorded in
  [`packages/etki-api/CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/yasinyaman/etki/blob/master/packages/etki-api/CHANGELOG.md).
- While `0.x`, breaking changes are allowed but announced — pin
  `etki-api>=0.1,<0.2` and set the same range as your `api_compat`; the loader
  refuses (loudly, never silently) plugins whose range doesn't cover the
  installed version.
- The public surface is exactly `etki_api.__all__` — enforced by
  `tests/unit/test_api_surface.py`. If you need a symbol that isn't exported,
  open an issue; don't reach into `etki.*`.

## Rules that keep the architecture honest

- **No vendor names in core.** If `engine/`, `indexing/` or `api/` needs to know
  it's talking to Acme, the design is wrong — push it into the adapter.
- **Normalize inside the adapter.** Units, field names, pagination, auth: none of
  it leaks past the port.
- **Declare capabilities truthfully.** `supports_effort_tracking=False` with a
  fallback beats fabricated efforts (single-point estimates are forbidden anyway).
- **Fail soft.** An unreachable backend must degrade the answer, not kill triage.
- **Secrets via `env:` references** — never plain text in config.

## Checklist for the PR

- [ ] One file under `etki/adapters/`, one branch in `registry.py`, zero core changes
- [ ] `effort_seconds` (or the port's equivalent) normalized and unit-tested from a captured payload
- [ ] Live-server tests CI-skipped; parsing tested without network
- [ ] `uv run ruff check . && uv run mypy etki && uv run pytest` green
- [ ] `uv run python -m eval.runner` still green (adapters shouldn't move it — if it moves, something leaked)
- [ ] A config example in your adapter's module docstring or the PR description
