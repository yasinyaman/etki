"""The plugin contract: what an ``etki.adapters`` entry point resolves to.

A plugin distribution declares one entry point in the ``etki.adapters`` group
pointing at a module-level ``PluginSpec`` instance:

    [project.entry-points."etki.adapters"]
    linear = "etki_plugin_linear:PLUGIN"

The loader (etki side) validates ``api_compat`` against the installed etki-api
version BEFORE any adapter is built; options are validated through
``AdapterFactory.options_model`` and secrets (``env:VAR`` references) are
resolved by the host BEFORE ``build()`` is called — a plugin never sees raw
secret references.
